# **Applied Data Science with R - Capstone Project Summary**

- **Objective:** Predict the number of bikes rented based on weather conditions in urban areas.

- **Regression Model Insights:**
  - Positive correlation found between demand and temperature.
  - Negative correlation observed between humidity and rainfall.

- **Methodology:**
  - Utilized diverse regression models for prediction.
  - An interactive map enhances visualization of estimated bike demand.

- **Data Collection:**
  - Comprehensive data collection from global bike-sharing systems, OpenWeather APIs, and cloud storage.
  - Specifics gathered from Seoul's bike-sharing systems, including major cities' information, weather details, and hourly bike rentals.

- **Data Wrangling:**
  - Stringr and regular expressions for column standardization and numeric value extraction.
  - Dplyr used for handling missing values, creating dummy variables, and normalizing data.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - SQL queries and data visualization techniques employed.
  - Insights obtained on bike-sharing systems, weather, and city-specific conditions.

- **Predictive Analysis:**
  - Multiple regression models evaluated using RMSE and RSQ values.
  - Models include baseline linear regression, higher-order polynomials, and penalties like Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net.

- **R Shiny Dashboard:**
  - Interactive interface for exploring bike demand predictions, temperature forecasts, and humidity-rental demand relationships across cities.

- **Conclusion:**
  - Valuable insights into bike-sharing demand and applied data science with R showcased.
  - Future avenues include exploring additional weather conditions and analyzing policy impacts on bike-sharing demand.
